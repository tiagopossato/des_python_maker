You can set one callback for each event. The callback is a function that takes the event as argument and is called when the event is successfully handled.

For handle an event, you can use the function `handle_event` that takes the event as argument.

`Events` is a dictionary with all the events. This is defined in the file `Supervisor/events.py`.
